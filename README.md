# Model-Train-Control
Complete software system for controlling model trains, implemented in Racket. The project integrates multiple components including a Command Station (Z21) via DCC protocol, Infrabel for infrastructure management, and NMBS with a graphical interface. Features include train movement control, track switch management, detection blocks, power-ups, levels, and wave-based scenarios. The system supports both a simulator and real hardware, allowing testing and modular development. Designed for large-scale software architecture, it emphasizes maintainability, modularity, and clear interface abstraction.
